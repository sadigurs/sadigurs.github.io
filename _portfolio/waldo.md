üîç **Where's Waldo? RP Edition!**


I decided to create a simple variation of the classic "Where's Waldo" game. One of the main inspirations for this game was to highlight the stark contrast in difficulty between those with Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) and those without. RP is an inherited eye disorder affecting the retina, leading to a gradual loss of vision over time. People with RP often experience tunnel vision, making it challenging to perceive their surroundings fully.

The initial idea was to illustrate this difficulty by the illustrating the gap between people with limited field of vision (due to RP) and those who are not. While for most people finding Waldo on an empty background will look like a ridiculously easy task, for people with limited field of vision this might not be so easy.

After this initial version of "Where's Waldo? RP Edition," I decided to incorporated a special "tunnel vision mode" to simulate the limited field of vision experienced by those with RP. This might serve as another illustration of how does it feel, at least at this 'toy' scenario, to have limited field of vision.

üéÆ **How to Play:**

I hope you enjoy playing "Where's Waldo? RP Edition" and gain a new perspective on the challenges faced by individuals with RP. Let me know what you think! üåü
